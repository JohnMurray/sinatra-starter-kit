# Sinatra Starter Kit v0.1


## What it is
This is my current Sinatra configuration that I like to start each new site with. It will evolve with me and is my personal pet-project. However, I feel like this could be useful to other people as well (that also enjoy Sinatra) and would like to share. If you have anything that you would like to add to the project, send me a pull request and if I like it I'll add it in. 


## What it is not
This is not intended to provide a Rails-like environment with all the necessary tools and auto-generation features you find in Rails. I love Sinatra because of its simplicity and I don't want to over-complicate things.
